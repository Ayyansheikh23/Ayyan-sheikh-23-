    <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>

    <hr color="white">


    <div class="first">
        <p class="abc">My favorite thing to do is programming and I have a lot of fun doing it. I also have a lot of fun
            solving any
            problem that comes up in programming. When I'm in class and learning something new, I also enjoy it when I'm
            learning and working.If you're learning programming, you should keep practicing. Sir says programming
            doesn't
            have to be learned by studying, it has to be learned by practicing.I have just reached CSS.
            I am happy that I am becoming a programmer. I pray for myself and I also pray for my friends who are
            learning
            programming with me. And I keep praying for everyone.
            May Allah make everyone successful in their goals, Amen.</p>
