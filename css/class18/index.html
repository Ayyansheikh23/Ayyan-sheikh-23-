            <td class="abc"> The Rhodes piano is an electro-mechanical piano, invented by Harold Rhodes during the
                fifties and later manufactured in a number of models, first in collaboration with Fender and after 1965
                by CBS. It employs a piano-like keyboard with hammers that hit small metal tines, amplified by
                electromagnetic pickups.

                The Wurlitzer electric piano is an electro-mechanical piano, created by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company of
                Mississippi. The Wurlitzer company itself never called the instrument an “electric piano”, instead
                inventing
                the phrase “Electronic Piano” and using this as a trademark throughout the production of the instrument.
                It
                employs a piano-like keyboard with hammers that hit small metal tines, amplified by electromagnetic
                pickups.

                A Clavinet is an electronically amplified clavichord manufactured by the Hohner company. Each key uses a
                rubber tip to perform a hammer on a string. Its distinctive bright staccato sound is often compared to
                that
                of an electric guitar.
